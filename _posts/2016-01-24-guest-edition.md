Allison had a friend in town, so they rented bikes in Hayes Valley and met us at Dolores Park Cafe for coffee. There's a bit of climbing on this trip, but it's fairly spread out and (mostly) gentle. Hiking at Land's End was gorgeous!

We got lucky with the wait at B*Star -- I think we waited only 30 minutes, which is short for that place! The tea leaf salad was delicious, and they were pretty accomodating about making things gluten free.
